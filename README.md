# ScriboGenie

> AI-powered multisensory handwriting assistant for children with learning disabilities.

---

## Overview

ScriboGenie is an AI-powered handwriting assistance system designed to support children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia and dysgraphia. The project combines machine learning, handwriting recognition, and a Flutter-based mobile application to provide an accessible and interactive handwriting learning experience.

The system captures handwritten input, processes it using a Python-based recognition engine, and analyzes writing patterns to provide intelligent feedback. By integrating artificial intelligence with assistive technology, ScriboGenie aims to improve handwriting practice, enhance learner confidence, and make personalized writing support more accessible.

## Problem Statement

Children with learning disabilities often struggle with handwriting due to difficulties in letter formation, writing fluency, and motor coordination. Traditional handwriting practice methods provide limited personalized guidance and little real-time feedback, making learning frustrating and less effective.

ScriboGenie addresses these challenges by providing an AI-assisted handwriting recognition system that analyzes handwritten input and delivers intelligent feedback to encourage continuous learning and independent practice.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sankavi03/scribogenie.git
```

### Navigate to the project

```bash
cd scribogenie
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Mobile Application

```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## How It Works

1. The user writes on the mobile application.
2. Handwritten input is captured and preprocessed.
3. The backend processes the handwriting.
4. The CNN model predicts handwritten characters.
5. The system analyzes writing quality.
6. Personalized feedback is provided to help improve handwriting.
